## 🎯 About The Project

> *"What if learning OS scheduling wasn't just reading a textbook — but actually managing a CPU under pressure?"*

**CPU Manager** is a gamified, browser-based simulator built as a final-year Operating Systems project. It transforms four core CPU scheduling algorithms — FCFS, SJF, Round Robin, and Priority Scheduling — into an interactive, animated game experience.

The user inputs their own processes (burst time, arrival time, priority), picks a scheduling strategy, watches the CPU execute them in real-time with full animation, and gets scored on their efficiency. After each level, all four algorithms run silently on the same data and display a side-by-side comparison — so you immediately see what you could have done better.

### Why this exists

Traditional OS education is abstract. Students memorize Gantt charts without ever *feeling* what it means for a process to wait too long, or for the CPU to sit idle. This project fixes that by making the consequences of every scheduling decision immediate, visual, and scored.

## ⚙️ Algorithms Implemented

### 🔵 FCFS — First Come First Served
Processes execute in the order they arrive. Simple and fair, but susceptible to the **convoy effect** when a long process blocks shorter ones behind it.
- **Best for:** Uniform workloads with similar burst times
- **Weakness:** High average waiting time with mixed process sizes

### 🟢 SJF — Shortest Job First
The process with the smallest burst time runs next. Provably **optimal for minimising average waiting time** in non-preemptive scheduling.
- **Best for:** Batch systems where burst times are known in advance
- **Weakness:** Long processes may starve indefinitely

### 🟣 RR — Round Robin
Each process gets a configurable **time quantum**. If not finished, it re-enters the queue. Guarantees fairness and responsiveness across all processes.
- **Best for:** Time-sharing systems, interactive workloads
- **Weakness:** High context-switching overhead with small quantum values

### 🟠 Priority Scheduling
Each process carries a priority number. Lower value = higher priority. Critical tasks are always executed before background work.
- **Best for:** Real-time systems where task urgency varies
- **Weakness:** Low-priority tasks may starve without an ageing mechanism

## 🎮 How To Play

1. **Watch the boot screen** — the game introduces itself with a typewriter animation
2. **Read the instructions** — learn what each algorithm does and how scoring works
3. **Select a level** — start with Level 1 (FCFS) and unlock higher levels
4. **Enter your processes** — set the number of processes, burst times, arrival times, and priorities
5. **Review the AI suggestion** — the system recommends an algorithm and explains why
6. **Accept or override** — pick your algorithm (or trust the AI)
7. **Watch the simulation** — processes animate through the CPU in real-time with a live Gantt chart
8. **See your score** — stars, rank, and metrics revealed with full animation
9. **Study the comparison** — all 4 algorithms run on your data so you can see what worked best
10. **Replay or advance** — improve your score or unlock the next level

---

## 🏆 Scoring System

```
Base Score = 100 points

Deductions:
  − 2 points  per unit of average waiting time above threshold
  − 1 point   per % of CPU utilisation below 80%

Bonuses:
  + 10 points if you accepted the AI recommendation and scored well
  + 5 points  for completing the simulation under the time limit
```

| Score | Stars | Rank |
|---|---|---|
| 90 – 100 | ⭐⭐⭐ | Expert CPU Manager |
| 70 – 89 | ⭐⭐ | Advanced |
| 50 – 69 | ⭐ | Intermediate |
| Below 50 | 💀 | Beginner — Try Again |

**Cumulative rank** across all levels: `Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced → Expert 🏆`

---

## 🤖 AI Recommendation System

The AI engine analyses your process set before every simulation and recommends the most suitable algorithm:

```javascript
function recommendAlgorithm(processes, level) {
  const variance = calculateBurstVariance(processes);

  if (level >= 4)       return "PRIORITY";  // Priority values present
  if (variance > 10)    return "SJF";       // High burst time variance
  if (count > 5)        return "RR";        // Many processes — fairness needed
  return "FCFS";                            // Uniform, simple workload
}
```

- The AI banner **types itself** onto the screen with its reasoning
- You can **Accept** (green) or **Override** (red — the banner shatters)
- If you override and score lower: `"AI was right this time 😏"`
- Accepting a correct recommendation awards **+10 bonus points**
